I created my first repo on Github
I cloned into my repo
On the first task i created a new directory into my repo, I also created a non-empty README.md file in the root of my repo and my directory
On the second task i created three directories named bash, c, js. I also created some empty files named c/c_is_fun.c
js/main.js
js/index.js..... I created some files(bash/alx, bash/school) and echoed some text into it using the nano editor.
On the third task i creadted a new branch named update_script and in the branch:
I created an empty file named bash/98
I updated bash/alx by replacing echo "ALX" with echo "ALX School"
I updated bash/school by replacing echo "School" with echo "The school is open!"
Then I switched back to the main branch and:
I updated the file bash/alx by replacing echo "ALX" with echo "ALX School is so cool!"
Deleted the directory js
